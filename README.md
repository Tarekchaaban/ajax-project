# crypto-catalog

A dynamic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript solo project for crypto enthusiasts looking to keep track of data on specific currencies, as well as aggregate their net worth across exchanges.

## :thinking: Why I built this

As a person who's been heavily involved in the crypto market, and made quite a lot of investments accross many exchanges - I felt that there was a hole in the industry regarding the aggregation of data across these exchanges. More often than not I would forget how much I owned given the multiple exchanges I would use, especially if I failed to use a spread sheet. My app helps me solve that problem while also keeping me updated on cryptocurrency valuation in real-time.
